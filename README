Modified Installation files for SLitrani. 

This is a walkthrough guide to installing ROOT, SLitrani and Git onto a Linux machine.

INTRODUCTION:
  When I went to use SLitrani there were many issues within the installation files so this GitHub Repository contains the files that I have modified to get SLitrani working onto my computer and those used at Warwick CSC. This guide is not meant to be exhaustive and you may need to do further edits yourself to get SLitrani running on your machine, I know for instance that certain linux versions are more picky about the makefiles than others and so I can only be sure this is working on the exact machine I'm using.

  I make no claim to this software, I simply am presenting the fixes I've made to get it running on my computers. SLitrani is owned by FranÃ§ois-Xavier Gentit and the original code is found here http://gentitfx.fr/SLitrani/. 
  If Mr Gentit is reading this please message me so I can send you the changes so that you can update your code so that newer systems can run this brilliant software!

LINUX VERSION: OpenSUSE 12.3 x64 (current as of 26-Sep-2013)

ROOT Version: 5.34/10 

HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE:
  Firstly read it all, its good to get an overview of what we are doing and why.
  Secondly use common sense, if you know a better way of doing what I'm trying to do, do it (and let me know how :)
  Code for terminal is written like:
    >cd root
  enter this: "cd root" in your terminal application.
  Any issues with this code please post an issue in GitHub.
  Finally if you have issues that cant be solved there my email address is m.d.abbott@warwick.ac.uk

1.Installing - ROOT
  ROOT is a well documented piece of software so you shouldn't have too many issues here, the one thing I'll say is install ALL prerequisites as the library MathMore does seem to need them (and I'll show you how to do this).
  NOTE: If you are working on a University managed machine (eg: Warwick CSC) ROOT may already be setup for you, check with your IT provider.

  1.a - Prerequisites and GIT
   Go to http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/build-prerequisites
   Follow this guide and install all required prerequisites AND all optional ones
   As of date this is done by:
    >sudo zypper install git bash make gcc-c++ gcc binutils \
        xorg-x11-libX11-devel xorg-x11-libXpm-devel xorg-x11-devel \
        xorg-x11-proto-devel xorg-x11-libXext-devel
        
   Optional to get ALL prerequisites:
    >sudo zypper install gcc-fortran libopenssl-devel \
        pcre-devel Mesa glew-devel pkg-config libmysqlclient-devel \
        fftw3-devel libcfitsio-devel graphviz-devel \
        libdns_sd avahi-compat-mDNSResponder-devel openldap2-devel \
        python-devel libxml2-devel krb5-devel gsl-devel libqt4-devel

        
  1.b - Download ROOT
   Load a terminal window (this should open in your home folder)
    
   Git Clone Root (equivilant to downloading)
    >git clone http://root.cern.ch/git/root.git
   Make a cup of tea, this takes a while.
    
   Tell Git to use the 5.34 branch of ROOT
    >cd root
    >git tag -l
    >git checkout -b v5-34-10 v5-34-10
   Drink said Tea, the temperature should be just about right.
    
  1.c - Compile ROOT
    Next you need to get ROOT to configure itself for your machine (you still need to be in the root directory so "cd root" if you need to):
     >./configure
    And as the instructions say on screen, run make:
     >make
    Now its time for your second cup of tea!
    
    Once this is done you'll be prompted to run:
    >source bin/thisroot.sh
    And you shoud be done!
    
  1.d - Test ROOT
    Its easy to test root, just run:
     >root
    And this should pop up the version number and the ROOT splash screen
    After this quit ROOT with:
     >.q
    Done!
  
2. Installing - SLitrani

  2.a Setting Addresses
    Just like driving a car, ROOT and SLitrani requires addresses to put its working files into.
    There is a file in your home directory called ".bashrc" this tells your computer what to run everytime you load a terminal window.
    We will use this to tell SLitrani where to install itself.
    First create a folder in your home directory called "rootdev".
    
    Add to .bashrc using an app like kwrite, the following lines :
    
      export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/rootdev/bin"
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PATH:$HOME/rootdev/lib"
      export ROOTDEV=$HOME/rootdev
      
      source $HOME/root/bin/thisroot.sh
      
   (If you cant see .bashrc it may be hidden, so show hidden files, still not there? create it!)
   Next Navigate to: /root/etc/ 
   There should be a file called "system.rootrc" copy this to your home directory.
   Rename this file to: ".rootrc"
   Find the line in this file that looks like: 
   
   Unix.*.Root.MacroPath:      .:$(ROOTSYS)/macros
   
   and then add to it so it looks like:
   
   Unix.*.Root.MacroPath:      .:$(ROOTSYS)/macros:$HOME/rootdev/macros:
   
   And then root will know where to look for SLitrani Macros.
   
  2.b Get SLitrani files
    If you havent already done so we need to download these SLitrani files.
    Open a new terminal window and type:
    >git clone https://github.com/brickmen/slitrani-fixed.git
    
    Now copy the folder "macros" into the rootdev folder you made earlier
    
    Create in rootdev, three folders: "bin", "include" and "lib".
    
    
  2.c Install SLitrani
    Firstly close terminal and open a new one (this ensures bashrc is properly loaded)
    Navigate to slitrani-fixed:
     >cd slitrani-fixed
    You'll be using three commands in each folder this order NOT YET!:
     >make clean
     >make
     >make install
    
    Run the three commands in each folder in this order:
      1.TwoPad
      2.SplineFit
      3.PhysMore
      4.SLitrani
      5.VisuSLitrani
    After each you should get a notification saying it is done at the end of "make". If "make" does not compile correctly then you need to read the code as to why, often this is due to missing out a previous section such as forgetting "make install" before running the next section.
    
  2.d Test SLitrani
    Well done if you've managed all these makefiles.
    
    To test SLitrani close terminal and open a new one.
    Navigate to slitrani-fixed
     >cd slitrani-fixed
    Now run ROOT on an SLitrani macros eg:
     >root SLitBeam01.C
    (they are in the rootdev/macros folder)
    
    You should see a window pop up called SLitrani (looks like slitraniwindow.png)
    Congratulations you have installed SLitrani.
    
    Please look at https://github.com/brickmen/slitrani-solar-simulator for what I used SLitani to make.
    
3 FURTHER INFO
  3.a What are SpectraDB.rdb and SplineFit.rdb? OR Im Getting: 
      " Error in <TFile::TFile>: file SplineFitDB.rdb does not exist"
      These two files are in slitrani-fixed and need to be copied into any directory you want to run SLitrani in.
      
  3.b I'm not using x64 linux
    Firstly check you are not, google it!
    Secondly get with the times! only joking :)
    Finally to get it working all you should need to do is go into every makefile and change all the "m64" into "m32". But I havent tested this!
    
  3.c I cant get it working and I'm pulling my hair out!!!!
    I know how you feel! It took me 3 weeks to get this working and help from anywhere I could get it! Drop me a line on m.d.abbott@warwick.ac.uk and I'll try to help.
    
THANKS FO READING, GOOD LUCK AND ENJOY SLITRANI!
